     * By default, this library will feed the environment variables directly to
     * the Zod validator.
     *
     * This means that if you have an empty string for a value that is supposed
     * to be a number (e.g. `PORT=` in a ".env" file), Zod will incorrectly flag
     * it as a type mismatch violation. Additionally, if you have an empty string
     * for a value that is supposed to be a string with a default value (e.g.
     * `DOMAIN=` in an ".env" file), the default value will never be applied.
     *
     * In order to solve these issues, we recommend that all new projects
     * explicitly specify this option as true.
